Run the Streamlit app to analyze free text for susceptibility to phishing, ransomware, social-engineering, and malware: place App.py and the dataset mbti_1.csv (with columns type and posts) in the project root, create/activate a Python 3.9–3.11 virtual environment, install dependencies (pip install streamlit spacy textblob transformers scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib pandas numpy), download the spaCy model with python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg, then start the UI using streamlit run App.py; the app cleans and featurizes text (lemmatization, sentiment, urgency/trust/fear cues, cybersecurity keywords), trains a Random Forest with SMOTE on the dataset at runtime, and returns a primary threat label, confidence, probability bars for all four classes, and key indicators—ensure mbti_1.csv is present (or you’ll get a file-not-found error) and expect the first run to be slower while models download.
